# Flask-TODO App

This is a simple web application for keeping track of your daily tasks (a TODO list) using **Flask** and **MySQL**.  
You can easily add new tasks, edit them, delete them, and mark them as done. The interface is simple and clean so you can focus on managing your tasks.

## 1. Features

- Quickly add, edit, and remove tasks
- Keep track of completed and pending tasks
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Data is stored safely in **MySQL**
- OTP (one-time password) can be sent to email for verification
- System errors are logged and saved in the `logs` folder

Some features might seem extra, but they were included mainly for **learning and experimentation** while exploring different aspects of Flask.

## 2. Stress Testing

Stress tests have been performed, and the results are saved in the `results test` folder.  
You can check them to see how the app behaves under load.  

These tests and extra features are primarily for **learning purposes**, so some parts might feel unnecessary for a basic TODO app. They helped me practice and understand more about web development with Flask.

## 3. Demo Video
